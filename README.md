Odds and fairs



Consider two 'Odds' given for a match to bet on, there is a math factor in it that if both of those odds add up to higher than a certain number, you can earn a profit by betting on both sides at the same time. 

When online tools use their programming to run the odds and fairs for a game, sometimes this error happens so that you can benefit off of it, not a get rich free plan where every bet can be won.


**IMPORTANT** Gambling is strictly not encouraged
